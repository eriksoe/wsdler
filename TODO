==== TO DO: ====
XSD:
- Split internal type for element into "name+attrs+children" and "occurs"
- Handle "ref" case for elements (incl. occurs-attributes)
- Type-annotations (and "dialyzer" Makefile target)
- Handle complexContent (in complexType).
- Handle import/include/redefine.
- Fix test sample file wrt. namespaces.
  * test-xsd-1: Items
  * test-xsd-14: Items
  * test-xsd-15: USAddress
  * test-xsd-16: PurchaseOrderType
  * test-xsd-15: Items
  * test-xsd-31: string
  * test-xsd-39: Items
- Fix test sample file wrt. incomplete schemas.
  * test-xsd-42: USAddress
  * test-xsd-27: UKPostcode
  * test-xsd-18: element "comment"
  * test-xsd-29: PurchaseOrderType
  * test-xsd-31: 
  * test-xsd-35:
  * test-xsd-28

==== DOING ====
- Integrate new phase-based approach. (eriksoe)

==== DONE: ====
- _wsdl: split into _xml (DOM parsing) and rest.
- _wsdl: split into _xsd and _wsdl.
- Sketch phased algorithm.
- Create index of named <element>s and <group>s.
  (By flattening)
- Handle <xs:element> element, as well as <xs element ref="id"/> references.
  (By flattening)
- Implement phase 1: "flatten and collect"
- Phase 3a - Order types by "base" relation.
