==== TO DO: ====
XSD:
- Type-annotations (and "dialyzer" Makefile target)
- Handle import/include/redefine.
  - Usable for predefined "xml" and "xsd" namespaces too.
- Fix test sample files which are invalid or incomplete. (see blacklist)
- Compute type properties after inheritance.
- Handle schema attr.s elementFormDefault and attributeFormDefault
  (see e.g. test-data-22.xsd)

- Resolve all TODOs.

== Milestone: Ability to perform a WSDL call, with any request content.
== Milestone: Ability to perform a WSDL call, with valid request content.
== Milestone: xml-lint tests succeed for schemas in test/data.
== Milestone: xml-lint tests succeed for randomly generated schemas.

==== DOING ====

==== DONE: ====
- _wsdl: split into _xml (DOM parsing) and rest.
- _wsdl: split into _xsd and _wsdl.
- Sketch phased algorithm.
- Create index of named <element>s and <group>s.
  (By flattening)
- Handle <xs:element> element, as well as <xs element ref="id"/> references.
  (By flattening)
- Implement phase 1: "flatten and collect"
- Phase 3a - Order types by "base" relation.
- Handle "ref" case for elements (incl. occurs-attributes)
  - Split internal type for element into "name+attrs+children" and "occurs"
- Handle complexContent (in complexType).
- Integrate new phase-based approach.
== Milestone: Old and new XSD approach fully integrated.
- Split XSD processing into multiple modules.
  - Introduce 'wsdler_xsd_conversion'.
- Tests of XSD consistency errors. (eriksoe)
